    <h2 style="text-align: center">Tutorial</h2>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>
        My greatest passion in life is sharing knowledge with others. Historically, 
        I've taught using in-person presentations, step-by-step guides, and with 
        the recent move to work from home, Microsoft OneNote notebooks to assist 
        my coworkers and employees. Today, we'll be doing something a bit more exciting. 
        In this section, I'll take you through how I create a guide by referencing
        one of the video games I play, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_2" target="_blank">
        Destiny 2</a>.
    </p>
    
    <br>

    <p> 
        With any guide I create, my first focus is the <b>purpose</b> of the guide. 
        <i>"What do I hope my reader will be able to achieve upon completion of this 
        guide?"</i> For my professional life, I aspire to have the employee 
        perform the task as seamlessly as possible. In our example, we'll be
        arming a player with an arsenal to defeat numerous enemies at once
        with plenty of defensive capabilities. 
    </p>

    <br>

    <p> 
        Here's where we set off into uncharted waters with our beloved reader. When 
        creating a guide, I like to start with a teaser to show the reader:
        <i>"When you are done with this tutorial, this is what you'll be able to do."</i>
        
        <br>
        <br>
    </p>

        <video class="FullBuild" width="700" height="400" controls> 
            <source src="clips/FullBuild_Trim.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>
            Let's get started. We'll be discussing the following with our player:
        <br>
        <br>
            <ol type="I">
                <li><a href="#weapons">Weapons</a></li>
                <li><a href="#subclass">Class and Subclass</a></li>
                <li><a href="#mods">Mods</a></li>
                <li><a href="#gameplay">Gameplay</a></li>
                <li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
            </ol>
        <br>
        <br>

        </p>
        It is imperative we gain our reader's trust. To do this, 
        we'll provide information followed immediately by preemptively answering 
        questions that may be thought of subsequently. First, let's tell our 
        reader which weapons we'll be using. Naturally, the next question is: 
        <i>"How do I obtain that weapon?"</i> or <i>"What does that weapon do?"</i>
        which we will answer within the table.

    <p>
        Now, the reader knows which weapons we are using, what they do, and where to
        obtain them... but what about the rest of the moves we were doing in the video?
        Let us offer a second piece of the puzzle. We are using the <b>Titan</b> class on the 
        <b>Behemoth</b> subclass, specifically. This subclass uses the <mark class="stasis">
        Stasis</mark> element to freeze and shatter enemies.

        At this point, our reader has been told what weapons to use and which class,
        subclass, and abilities to select. During the tutorial process, I like to connect some dots
        for the reader and let him or her do the rest once he or she is comfortable. With 
        this section, we'll place the final dots and then begin connecting them together.
        We've already planted the ideas in their mind by calling out <mark class="stasis">
        Stasis crystals</mark> and <mark class="shard">Stasis shards</mark>. Let's double
        down on that now.

        If this guide was an instruction manual to assemble furniture, what we have covered

        so to speak. This is where the magic happens. With our reader's mind primed with 
        certain ideas, we can show how everything will string together. Let's discuss my 
        favorite part, <b>gameplay</b>.

    <br>
    <br>

    <p>
        Ladies and gentlemen, this is what you've come for. Our objective is simple:
        to freeze and shatter as many targets as possible using our variety of 
        <mark class="stasis">Stasis</mark> damaging capabilities. 
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <div class="gifs">
        <img src="clips/Shards.gif" alt="Shattering crystal grenade for shards"
        class="clips">
    
    <p>
        The mods we went over are primarily based on creating and picking up 
        <mark class="shard">Stasis shards </mark> to increase our damage with <b>Font
        of Might</b>, increase our damage resistance with Protective Light, and 
        give us bonus health in the form of an overshield. The quickest way to
        begin is by using our Glacier Grenade and shattering the crystals with the
        Titan's <b>Barricade</b> ability. Thanks to <b>Whisper of Shards</b>,
        our grenade will regenerate much more quickly. So if we're expecting a fight, we'll
        do this first.
    </p>

    <br>

    <div class="gifs2">
    <img src="clips/headstone.gif" alt="Headstone perk in action"
    class="clips">

    <p>
        Once our mods are kickstarted, we'll begin the slaying with Eyasluna and Headstone. As mentioned 
        in the <a href="#weapons">Weapons</a> section, Headstone spawns a <mark class="stasis">Stasis crystal
        </mark> at the vicitm's location when defeated with a headshot. We can then shoot
        that crystal to deal damage to all enemies in the vicinity.

    <div class="gifs">
        <img src="clips/DiamondLance.gif" alt="Diamond Lance destroying enemies"
        class="clips">

    <p>
        As discussed in the <a href="#subclass">Abilities</a> section, any targets
        defeated by <mark class="stasis">Stasis</mark> damage (e.g. using our
        Eyasluna, defeating enemies by destroying <mark class="stasis">Stasis
        crystals</mark>, etc.) spawns a Diamond Lance. 
        This powerful tool can clear multiple enemies in one attack.
    </p>

    </div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <div class="gifs2">
        <img src="clips/Cloudstrike.gif" alt="Cloudstrike defeating enemies"
        class="clips">
    <p> 
        If we need to dispose of multiple enemies from a safe distance, Cloudstrike
        has us covered. This weapon can clear multiple enemies with a headshot.
    </p>
    </div>

        <p> 
            If there is an enemy with a lot of health or someone who is too close 
            for comfort, we can use the Zephyr to dispose of the target quickly with
            a powerful slash (or two).

    <br>
    <p>
        With the build we've created together, we've shown our reader what the critical
        components are. We discussed the weapons and provided sources on how to obtain them,
        which class and subclass to use with corresponding abilities, which mods to equip
        in your armor to gain their benefits, and shown what the build can do in short 
        demonstrations, as well as a full video of how it all comes together at the top. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        For our reader, the fun has just begun. Now they can set foot out into the world
        and slay countless enemies with a strong build balancing potent offense and 
        reliable defense. As for us, with the Behemoth Titan build complete, our 
        job is complete. Thanks for coming along and creating this guide with me.
        I hope you enjoyed reading as much as I enjoyed writing it!
