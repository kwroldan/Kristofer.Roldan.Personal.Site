    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        Hey everyone! I began my humble career at Ford Credit after graduating 
        with a BS in Business Administration from the University of South Florida 
        in 2016. I am married to my wonderful wife, Alycia, who I have a "mini zoo" 
        with (four pets: two cats and two dogs).

        <br>
        I currently work as a supervisor for Ford Pro FinSimple in the Commercial 
        Originations department and jointly oversee 30-35 individuals. Prior to 
        this assignment, I was a designated subject matter expert and trainer 
        for our Commercial Line of Credit department to assist our new analysts 
        with learning our processes. Admittedly, I am just as passionate about 
        learning new things as I am teaching them.

            Being a software engineer would be an awesome experience, as it would enhance my 
            capabilities as a teacher and creator. Historically, I've utilized Microsoft Office
            applications, but think of the possibilities with developing software. Additionally, 
            I love playing video games in my spare time, and getting to know some of the 
            behind-the-scenes and having the capability to create an website that interacts 
            with its API as a side hobby invigorates me!
